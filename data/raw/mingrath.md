> A curated list of awesome [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skills -- markdown-based instruction files that extend Claude Code's capabilities as a coding agent.

Claude Code skills are specialized folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude dynamically discovers and loads when relevant. They live in `~/.claude/skills/` (personal) or `.claude/skills/` (project-level) directories and follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) specification.

## What Are Claude Code Skills?

Claude Code skills are markdown-based instruction files that teach Claude how to perform specific tasks in a repeatable way. Each skill is a directory containing:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── templates/         # Templates for output
├── examples/          # Example outputs
├── scripts/           # Helper scripts
└── references/        # Reference documentation
```

The `SKILL.md` file uses YAML frontmatter to configure behavior and markdown content for instructions:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write
---

Instructions for Claude go here...
```

Skills are invoked in two ways:
- **Automatically** -- Claude detects when a skill is relevant and loads it.
- **Manually** -- Type `/skill-name` in Claude Code to invoke directly.

For the full specification, see the [official skills documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

## How to Install a Skill

**Personal skills** (available across all projects):

```bash
# Clone or copy a skill into your personal skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r path/to/some-skill ~/.claude/skills/some-skill
```

**Project skills** (available only in that project):

```bash
# Add to your project's .claude/skills/ directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills/
cp -r path/to/some-skill .claude/skills/some-skill
# Optionally commit to version control
git add .claude/skills/some-skill
```

**From a Git repository:**

```bash
# Clone into personal skills
git clone https://github.com/user/some-skill ~/.claude/skills/some-skill
```

## What Makes a Good Skill

A high-quality Claude Code skill should follow these principles:

### Structure

- **Single responsibility.** Each skill should do one thing well. A `deploy` skill deploys. A `test-generator` skill generates tests. Do not combine unrelated concerns.
- **Clear frontmatter.** Include a descriptive `name` and `description` so Claude knows when to load the skill. The description is your skill's discovery mechanism.
- **Concise SKILL.md.** Keep the main file under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material, API docs, and long examples to supporting files.
- **Supporting files.** Use `reference.md`, `examples/`, `templates/`, and `scripts/` directories for content that should only load on demand.

### Instructions

- **Be specific and actionable.** Vague instructions produce vague results. Tell Claude exactly what steps to follow, what patterns to use, and what output to produce.
- **Include examples.** Show Claude what good output looks like. Examples are worth more than paragraphs of description.
- **Define constraints.** Specify what Claude should NOT do. Constraints prevent common failure modes.
- **Use dynamic context.** The `!`command`` syntax lets you inject live data (git status, file contents, API responses) into the skill at runtime.

### Behavior

- **Use `disable-model-invocation: true`** for skills with side effects (deploy, publish, send messages). You do not want Claude auto-triggering these.
- **Use `context: fork`** for research or exploration skills that should run in isolation without consuming your conversation context.
- **Restrict tools with `allowed-tools`** to limit what Claude can do. A read-only research skill should not have write access.
- **Handle arguments.** Use `$ARGUMENTS`, `$0`, `$1` for flexible input. Document expected arguments in the skill description.

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] Does the skill have a clear, specific description?
- [ ] Does it follow a single responsibility?
- [ ] Are instructions actionable and specific?
- [ ] Are side-effect skills marked with `disable-model-invocation: true`?
- [ ] Is the SKILL.md under 500 lines?
- [ ] Does it include examples of expected output?
- [ ] Has it been tested with real-world use cases?
